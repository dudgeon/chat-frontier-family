# Product Requirements Document: AI Chat Application

## Overview
This document outlines the specifications and functionality of our AI chat application, designed to provide users with a conversational interface powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o model.

## Product Description
The application is a web-based chat interface that allows users to have interactive conversations with an AI assistant. The app features a clean, modern design with customizable themes, API key management, and chat organization capabilities.

## Core Features

### 1. Chat Interface
- **Messaging System**: Users can send text messages to the AI and receive responses in a conversational format
- **Message Display**: Messages are displayed in a scrollable feed with distinct styling for user and AI messages
- **Thinking Indicator**: A visual indication when the AI is processing a response
- **Pre-wrap Formatting**: Messages maintain line breaks and formatting for improved readability

### 2. API Integration
- **OpenAI Connection**: Integration with OpenAI's GPT-4o model via Supabase Edge Functions
- **API Key Management**: Users can securely store their OpenAI API key in the browser's local storage
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for API failures with user-friendly error messages

### 3. UI/UX Features
- **Customizable Theme**: Users can select from predefined color themes for the interface
- **Responsive Design**: The application adapts to different screen sizes and devices
- **Settings Panel**: Side panel for accessing application settings and chat history
- **Auto-generated Chat Names**: Chat sessions are automatically named based on conversation content after the third AI response

### 4. Data Management
- **Local Storage**: User preferences and API keys are stored in the browser's local storage
- **Chat Session Management**: Framework for managing multiple chat sessions (implementation in progress)

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS styling
- **State Management**: React Context API for application state
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation

### Backend
- **Serverless Functions**: Supabase Edge Functions for secure API integrations
- **API Handling**: Abstracted API calls with proper error handling

### Modular Code Structure
- **Contexts**: ChatContext for managing chat state
- **Hooks**: 
  - useApiKey: Handles API key storage and retrieval
  - useMessageHandler: Manages message state and API interactions
- **Utils**:
  - chatNameGenerator: Generates chat names based on conversation content
  - colorUtils: Manages theme color application

## User Flow
1. User opens the application and sees the welcome message from the AI
2. User configures their OpenAI API key in the settings panel
3. User sends messages and receives AI responses in real-time
4. After several exchanges, the chat is automatically named
5. User can customize the interface color through the settings panel
6. User can access previous chat sessions through the history panel (feature in progress)

## Future Enhancements
- Multiple chat session management
- User authentication and cloud storage of chat history
- Additional AI model options
- Voice input/output capabilities
- Attachment and image support
- Mobile application

## Technical Limitations
- Currently relies on client-side API key storage
- Limited to text-based interactions
- Chat history is persisted in Supabase
- Single chat session at a time

## Conclusion
The AI Chat Application provides a functional, user-friendly interface for interacting with AI models. Its modular design allows for easy expansion and enhancement of features in future iterations.
